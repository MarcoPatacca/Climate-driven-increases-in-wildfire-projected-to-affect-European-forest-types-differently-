The repository contains the data behind the main findings of the article titled: Climate-driven increases in wildfire projected to affect European forest types differently by Patacca, M., et al.
The file called Historical_fire_values.csv includes the historical burned area and fire damage values and their statistics for the period 1994:2023.
The burned_area_scenario.csv file contains:
- The modelled distribution of the burned area (BA) Bayesian models described as median (size_redicted_median), lower (size_predicred_lower) and upper (size_predicted_upper) 95% confidence interval;
- The five realised scenarios randomly sapled from this distribution (area_to_burn1:5)
- for each country, global climate model, socioeconomical pathway and for all the analysed years (2025:2098).
The file called country_damages.RDS contains a summary of simulated total country damages per GCM-SSP and year.

If you may have any question regarding the data, the EFISCNE-space model or the code produced to summarise those results please reach out at pataccamarco@gmail.com
